# A Quick and Dirty implementation of the GRL.

Here we present the GRL as a library.

The library has been designed to facilitate the creation of new modelling languages based on the GRL itself.

* The project is managed using gradle.
* There are minimal tests.
* See examples in tests on how to use.
* Documentation is sparse.
